Installation needed: python 3.9


Run the program "ScenarioImplementation.py" for the implementation without chain of dependencies.



Run the program "ChainOfDependenciesImplementation.py" for the implementation with chain of dependencies.


In both cases, the user need to give input 1,2,3 or 4 for the prompt "How may requests do you want to process ?" and give input initial, ongoing or post for the prompt "when are you calculating dependencies?" Each request is sent for 10 times. In implementation without chain, the dependent activities are updated once and later, the number of updates may reduce due to the activity already having its desired state.
